## About This Site

This is the start of the "En Clave de Lana" site. It's a work in progress, and still needs a lot of work (and I mean, a lot!): Vue.js and Tailwind implementation, styling, middlewares, tests, social media sharing... Maybe in the future an e-commerce, too!

Anyway, if you have any suggestion, feel free to share it with us, we'll be very grateful!

See you in the web!

The ECDL Team
